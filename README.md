Welcome to the JediVerse, a complete encyclopedia of the people,planets, and films that make up the Star Wars franchise! Take a deep dive into the Star Wars universe and learn more about some of the franchise's most famous characters. This application was built using SWAPI(Star Wars API) and React, I used the various endpoints to pull specific information such as the people, planets, and etc. 

## Getting Started

In order to view the JediVerse local, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

*Also, one more thing...enjoy the music!*
